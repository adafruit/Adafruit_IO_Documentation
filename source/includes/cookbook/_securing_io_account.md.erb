# Securing your IO Account

Your IO Account includes a secret API key. This key is private and should not be shared with anyone.

But, a common pitfalls of the key is it may be accidentally shared by posted code on GitHub or social media. If anyone gains access to your key, **they will have access to your Adafruit IO account**.

## I accidentially shared my key, what do I do now?

You'll need to generate a new key. This process is simple, but not reversable. Once you generate a new key for your Adafruit IO account,
all devices using the previous Adafruit IO key will need to be updated to the new key.


To rengenerate your Adafruit IO Key:
* Navigate to io.adafruit.com and log into your account.
* Click the key icon on the header.
* Click the "Regenerate Key" button and confirm the action.
* The value of "Active Key" will change to a new key. Replace all instances of the previous key with the new one.
